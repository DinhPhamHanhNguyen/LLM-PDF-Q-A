LLMs can enhance their performance through the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a technique that aids in their improvement.
Enhance the accuracy of generative outcomes by incorporating relevant information from a specific document source to respond to an input query. In this project, we will explore the process of creating a basic RAG program. Simultaneously, implement the program on question and answer documents from the AIO course. Here are the input and output of the program:
• Input: Document file that needs Q&A and a question related to the content of the document.
• Output: Response.
